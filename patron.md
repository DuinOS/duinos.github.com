The DuinOS Project is a non-profit OpenSource project aimed at teaching how to use Threads, however it is possible to use it in projects of any nature with Arduino.

In order to maintain the project and its maintainer, Carlos Delfino, he seeks supporters, who contribute with specific signs for code tests and improvements.

## Project Maturity

Both Arduino and FreeRTOS are mature and widely tested platforms, but the portability of FreeRTOS to the chips used in modules and boards offered by the Arduino system, within the Arduino Development methodology, are not 100% tested and need fine tuning to that one succeeds.

## What to Contribute

The Sponsor can contribute to the project in several ways, making donations of boards such as Arduino Potenza, Arduino Due, Arduino Zero, among others, WiFI / Ethernet / GSM, robotics and diverse control modules. As well as financial resources for purchases and payments of licenses and fees.

## Advantage in Sponsoring

The advantage obtained by becoming a sponsor is to be able to direct the development of the project and thus obtain free consultancy for your own project.

Carlos Delfino as the Project maintainer is committed to seeking solutions that involve the use of DuinOS for the success of his project, dedicating some limited hours as a reward for the sponsorship, and a generous discount for overtime programming can even be negotiated.

## What Architectures Are Involved

The DuinOS Project is primarily aimed at two architectures:

* AVR (in particular ATMega328 - Arduino UNO and ATMega2560 - Arduino Mega, ATMega32U4 - Arduino Leonardo)
* Cortex-M (especially Cortex-M0 - Arduino Zero, Cortex-M3 - Arduino Due, Cortex-M7 - Arduino Potenza H7)
* ESP (ESP32, ESP8266 and other variants that accept RTOS)

## How to Sponsor.

As stated, it is possible to donate plates that are more advanced, in particular that are powered by Cortex-M, Cortex-R and AVR microcontrollers. Modules compatible with Arduino, according to the architecture you want to sponsor the development.

The Sponsor may also donate in cash, to pay for licenses or fees involved in the purchase and delivery of the donated items, by him or by others, thus forming a group of sponsors.

Cash donations can be sent via PayPal or via NuBank, contact us for details of the sponsorship.

Bonus sponsorships for the results of DuinOS can be made via PayPal by sending by e-mail Compras@carlosdelfino.eti.br.
